# FileSum
The purpose of this FileSum program is to enchance the previous   * program named FileSum (program that read floating   * point values from a file and perform analysis of those   * values). It will allow the output that was previously   * displayed at the terminal (console) to be written to a file.  * This program will prompt users for a file name  * and will attempt to open the file entered then the program will  * write to this file, not read from the file.   * This program will now have two try-catch constructs that will deal  * with FileNotFoundException when the application runs. One will be   * associated with the opening of the input file and the other is associated   * with the opening of the output file. The program will notify users that the file cannot be found if this exception is thrown, so the program will terminate.
